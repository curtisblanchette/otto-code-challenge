# Otto Code Challenge

This was fun because I haven't written PHP or jQuery in years (LOL); 

I decided to move the getRecords function into its own file where it could echo out json_encoded data.
This enabled me to perform an ajax request to populate the table asynchronously.
I then loaded that JSON into a DataTable using https://datatables.net/.
Strictly for presentational purposes... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
